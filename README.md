# fe-npv

Excersize solves the following problem:

> Your task is to develop a basic app that allows the user to calculate the NPV of a series of cash flows. The user should be able to input an analysis date, a discount rate, and a cash flow series, then click a button to run the calculation. The user will then see a table with the calculated PV of each cash flow, and the NPV of the entire series. See the included wireframe for an illustration of what the interface could look like. For simplicity’s sake, the cash flow series input will be a tab-delimited string, which the user will paste into a multiline text field on the page. Each line of the string will be of the format “[Date]<tab character>[Amount]”. You can assume that this string will be well-formed according to this spec, and that dates will be formatted as displayed below (m/d/y).
